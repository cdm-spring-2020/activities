# Create a Clip Library and Make a Soundscape 

## Part I: 

In *Writer/Designer*, Arola et. al. make a distinction between sources and assets. This activity should help you think about the differences between the materials you use "to gather information about a topic or genre" and the "piece of content that you'll actually use in your project" (61). Using Audacity, you will create a shared clip library made of sound assets that you will eventually use to construct a soundscape of an imaginary location. 

Regarding the location you choose, there are no limits--"surreal," "alien," and "uncharted" are all highly encouraged provided that in the end, there's a clear shared notion of how a listener might come away with a distinct sense of place. This aspect of the assignment is meant to connect to this week's theme: indirect expression. You should do this part of the assignment before gathering clips, and you should write a brief (1-2 sentences) description of your location before moving on to the next step. (Save this description and includ eit when you assemble your final portfolio.)

The idea behind assembling a clip library is to find and curate downloadable sound files that can be saved under specific filenames and used by any teammate. As such, these assets need to be named descriptively (e.g. "waterfall-sounds.wav") and well documented in a text file (where did the clip come from, what was the original file, how should it be cited?). For info on citing common audio formats, see https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/09/

Files should be high-quality audio (wav preferred) and should include only the relevant sound. In other words, if you have an eight-minute audio file that's a fully developed background music track, that's just fine. But "waterfall-sounds.wav" has seven minutes of irrelevant audio, that should be removed. Cutting a longer file into multiple clips is encouraged. The clip library, the citation guide text file, and the description of your location should all be submitted on Box. 

Here are some websites that specialize in sharing creative commons audio files:

## Part II

You will use the library you and your teammates assembled to make a soundscape of an imaginary location that is exactly 60 seconds long. According to Bernie Krause and R. Murray Schafer, a soundscape is "a sound or a combination of sounds that forms or arises from an environment." Soundscapes can be divided into three distinct concepts: keynote sounds, sound signals, and soundmarks. Keynote sounds (wind, water, forests, plains, birds, insects, animals, traffic) create an almost musical key or through-line to a soundscape. Sound signals jump to the foreground and are "listened to consciously." Soundmarks are sounds that are "unique to an area." (See https://www.sonospace.org/soundscape/ for more information and additional soundscape concepts.) Here's an example called ["Pacific Fanfare."](http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/excerpts/PacificFanfare.mp3)

As with Photoshop, you are encouraged to spend time familiarizing yourself with the basic menu operations of Audacity (remember the 80/20 rule) and identifying specific areas for experimentation. By the end of class, a 60-second audio clip representing your individual soundscape should be submitted on Box. (Submit the project file and an exported 16-bit PCM .wav file.)

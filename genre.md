# Genre Association and Representation

Last week, we talked about consciousness as an essential element of narrative, and we began to use photoshop to engage with concepts that help makers emphasize certain aspects of their work. This week, our theme is expectations. Some of the principles of design we've already discussed relate to expectations: things like the golden grid and the Gutenberg diagram are reinforced by the structures users expect to see. Similarly, since various media afford different modes of expression, medium also generates expectations. Lastly, we read about genre this week, which is arguably the one expectation-setter to rule them all. 

Expectatations can be met or played with but, as the Arola et. al. tell us (by example) that there are two important questions we might want to ask ourselves as we play with genre: 

1. Do you need to follow a genre convention for some reason related to audience comprehension or approval? 

2. Are there good reasons to break with this genre convention?

In class tonight, we we break into teams of 2-3 students and continue our experiments with Photoshop. Following the advice of Arola et. al., we'll play with genre by association and representation. Your team will receive a piece of paper with two genres on it. As a group, you will find an digital image of a movie poster belonging to one of those two genres and work together to edit the poster into the second genre. (You can choose for yourselves which will be the source genre and the target genre. Divide up the work however you choose, but make sure everyone has a role. Upload your work to your Box.com folder for Composing Digital Media when you are finished.

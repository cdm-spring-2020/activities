# Asynchronous activities

The general purpose of these instructions is to allow students to complete all remaining work for the semester on their own timetable. Items are listed in the recommended order, but how you go about completing each item is largely up to you. For your convenience, I have also included a suggested due date. It will be your responsibility, however, to complete work and keep your checklist up to date.

	__Suggested due date__: April 6

7. Complete Quiz 5

	Sarah Horton and Whitney Quesenbery write about the importance of inclusive design, which includes the principles of designing for differences, having well defined goals, building to standards, easing interactions, creating helpful wayfinding that guides users, having clean presentation that supports meaning, using plain language, implementing media that supports all senses, and creating delight. Do an inventory of your Github pages site and write a 500-word response indicating all the ways you are following or not following these principles. In cases where you are falling short, provide details on how you might improve. Turn in your written response via your Box folder. 

	__Suggested due date__: April 6

8. Turn in Pecha Kucha screencast/narration

	(If you have already delivered your Pecha Kucha, skip to item 9.) If you haven't yet delivered your Pecha Kucha, I am asking you to record delivering your Pecha Kucha and share a video via Box. You can do this by making a screencast recording, or by recording a timed narration. The screencast option is relatively simple and can be done with Zoom (see https://blog.smu.edu/itconnect/2017/08/23/using-zoom-create-quick-easy-screen-recordings-free/) In powerpoint, there is a menu item to "record slide show." (More details at https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c) In Google Slides, you have to record your audio separately, so the screencast option is probably best. 

	__Suggested due date__: April 8

9. Put your Pecha Kucha slides on your Github pages website under the link for "Work-in-Progress Presentation." 
	
	Instructions for this action will vary based on the format of your presentation, but the slides should be embedded onto the page, not merely linked or downloadable. For Google slides, this means embedding an iframe. See https://help.edublogs.org/google-slides/ and https://datavizforall.org/iframe-github.html. For PowerPoint users, converting your document to slideshare may be the best strategy. Once you have uploaded your slideshow, you can get an iframe embed code (see https://www.slideshare.net/thinkoutsidetheslide/converting-your-written-content-to-a-slideshare-deck/50-Embed_using_the_iframe_codeUse).

	__Suggested due date__: April 13

10. Complete soundscape activity, parts 1 and 2 (requires audacity) https://github.com/cdm-spring-2020/activities/blob/master/soundscape.md

	__Suggested due date__: April 15

11. Complete peer review assignment

	For this assignment, I have assigned partners for all students. By the due date, you will visit your partner's Github Pages site and provide the responses (1-2 sentences per numbered item) to the prompts linked below. Email your responses to your partner and CC me so I know you have completed the assignment.
